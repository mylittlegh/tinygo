// This file implements the 'chan' type and send/receive/select operations.

// A channel can be in one of the following states:
//     empty:
//       No goroutine is waiting on a send or receive operation. The 'blocked'
//       member is nil.
//     recv:
//       A goroutine tries to receive from the channel. This goroutine is stored
//       in the 'blocked' member.
//     send:
//       The reverse of send. A goroutine tries to send to the channel. This
//       goroutine is stored in the 'blocked' member.
//     closed:
//       The channel is closed. Sends will panic, receives will get a zero value
//       plus optionally the indication that the channel is zero (with the
//       commao-ok value in the coroutine).
//
// A send/recv transmission is completed by copying from the data element of the
// sending coroutine to the data element of the receiving coroutine, and setting
// the 'comma-ok' value to true.
// A receive operation on a closed channel is completed by zeroing the data
// element of the receiving coroutine and setting the 'comma-ok' value to false.
